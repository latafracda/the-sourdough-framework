However, some keygens come with default icons that are not very appealing or relevant to the game. If you want to change the icon of your PES 6 keygen, you can follow these three easy steps:
 
1. Download an icon file that you like. You can find many free icons online, or you can create your own using an image editor. Make sure the icon file has a .ico extension and is 32x32 pixels in size.
2. Rename the icon file to the same name as your keygen file. For example, if your keygen file is called pes6.exe, rename your icon file to pes6.ico.
3. Place the icon file in the same folder as your keygen file. Windows will automatically use the icon file as the new icon for your keygen file.

That's it! You have successfully changed the icon of your PES 6 keygen. Now you can enjoy your customized game icon and play PES 6 with ease.
  
Changing the icon of your PES 6 keygen is not only a cosmetic improvement, but also a security measure. Some antivirus programs may detect keygens as malware and delete them from your computer. By changing the icon, you can make your keygen less suspicious and avoid losing it.
 
However, changing the icon does not guarantee that your keygen will work properly. Some keygens may be outdated or incompatible with your game version. If you encounter any problems with your keygen, you may need to find another one or buy a legitimate license for PES 6.

Alternatively, you can buy a legal license for PES 6 and enjoy the game without any risks or hassles. You can find PES 6 on various online stores, such as Steam, Amazon, or eBay. You can also download PES 6 from official websites, such as Konami or PES Patch.
