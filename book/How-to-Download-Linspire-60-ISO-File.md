The physical media costs $39.99 and includes an install media and a one-year support license. You can also order a box set that includes both the digital download and the physical media for $49.99.

## How to Install Linspire
 
Installing Linspire is a simple and straightforward process that can be done in a few steps. Before you start, make sure you have a compatible computer with at least 2 GB of RAM and 20 GB of free disk space. You also need a USB flash drive or a DVD with the Linspire ISO file written on it. You can use Balena Etcher or any other image writing software to create a bootable media.

3. When the live session loads, you will see the Linspire desktop with a welcome screen. Click on the "Install Linspire" icon to launch the installer.
4. Follow the instructions on the installer to choose your language, keyboard layout, time zone, and partitioning scheme. You can either use the entire disk or create custom partitions for Linspire. Make sure you back up any important data before proceeding.
5. When you are ready, click on "Install Now" to start the installation process. This may take some time depending on your hardware and internet speed.
6. When the installation is complete, you will be asked to create a user account and a password. You can also choose whether to encrypt your home folder or not.
