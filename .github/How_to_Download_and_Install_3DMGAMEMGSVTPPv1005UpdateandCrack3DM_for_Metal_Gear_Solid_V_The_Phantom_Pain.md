The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, story, graphics, and open-world design, but was also criticized for its incomplete plot and controversial issues such as microtransactions and cut content. The game was also a commercial success, selling over six million copies worldwide.
 
However, many PC gamers who wanted to play the game without buying it had to wait for a long time for a working crack. The game was protected by Denuvo, a notorious anti-tamper technology that prevents unauthorized copying and modification of games. Many cracking groups tried to bypass Denuvo, but only one succeeded: 3DMGAME.
 
3DMGAME is a Chinese cracking group that has cracked many Denuvo-protected games such as FIFA 15, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Batman: Arkham Knight, and Just Cause 3. They released their first crack for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain on September 7th, 2015, just four days after the game's official release. However, this crack was unstable and had many bugs and glitches. They updated their crack several times until they released their final version on September 8th, 2015: 3DMGAME-MGSV.TPP.v1.005.Update.and.Crack-3DM.
 
This crack fixed most of the issues of the previous versions and allowed PC gamers to enjoy the game without any major problems. However, this crack also had some drawbacks: it only worked on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, it required a Chinese VPN to activate the game, and it did not support online features such as Metal Gear Online and FOB missions.
 
If you want to download and install this crack for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the game from any torrent site or direct download link. You can use this link as an example: [Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (v1.15 + All DLCs + MULTi8) â \[DODI Repack\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/q58yw7/metal_gear_solid_v_the_phantom_pain_v115_all_dlcs/). Make sure you download the CPY version of the game, not the Steam version.
2. Download the crack from this link: [3DMGAME-MGSV.TPP.v1.005.Update.and.Crack-3DM](https://www.reddit.com/r/TPPcrack/comments/3k45a5/3dmgamemgsvtppv1005updateandcrack3dm/). This is the genuine 3DM file, not a fake or a virus.
3. Extract the crack files to your game folder. Overwrite any existing files when prompted.
4. Run MGSTPP.exe as administrator. The game will launch and ask you to create a new profile. Choose any name you want.
5. The game will then ask you to activate it online. You will need to use a Chinese VPN to do this. You can use any free VPN service such as [VPN Gate](https://www.vpngate.net/en/) or [Panda VPN](https://www.pandavpn.pro/). Connect to a Chinese server and then click on "Activate". The game will verify your profile and then start.
6. Enjoy the game! You can disconnect from the VPN once the game starts. However, you will need to use it again every time you launch the game.

Note: This crack does not work on
